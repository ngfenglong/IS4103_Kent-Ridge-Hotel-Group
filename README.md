# IS4103 Kent Ridge Hotel Group System (Capstone Project)
IS4103 Capstone Project

Recommended IDE: Netbeans 8.2

This repository houses the codebase for the Kent Ridge Hotel Group System, a project developed as part of a university capstone project back in 2018. It is built primarily using Java, utilizing JSF and Managed Bean technology.

## üö® Project Status: Archived
This project is no longer maintained and has not been updated since its completion in 2018. It served its purpose for academic evaluation and is kept public as a reference to my contributions and approach to system development during that time.

## üõ†Ô∏è Modules
The system is composed of several modules, each serving a distinct function within the hotel management context. Here‚Äôs a brief overview of the included modules:

- **Room and Facilities Management:** Manages room bookings and facility reservations.
- **Housekeeping Management:** Oversees housekeeping tasks and scheduling.
- **Front Desk Management:** Handles check-ins, check-outs, and customer inquiries.
- **Human Resource Management:** Manages employee data and HR-related tasks.
- **Customer Portal:** Allows customers to interact with the hotel‚Äôs services online.
- **Room Service Management:** Manages room service requests and orders.
- **Sales and Marketing Management:** Handles promotions and marketing campaigns.
- **Reporting and Analytics:** Provides insights through various reports and analytics.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer
The code within this repository was developed under a tight timeline and with a considerable scope, which has resulted in a lack of clean code practices and potential security vulnerabilities. It‚Äôs kept primarily for historical and reference purposes.

### Security Vulnerabilities
This project has known security vulnerabilities, and it's advised not to use it in a production environment. It remains public as a display of my developmental journey and not as a representation of best practices.

## üìö Context
The emphasis on outdated technologies like JSF and Managed Bean is purely due to academic requirements at the time of development. This project is a representation of my ability to contribute significantly to a codebase and to develop functional software solutions within constraints.
